# simple_linear_regression
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables â€” one independent (x) and one dependent (y). It fits a straight line, represented as y = m*x + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. It helps predict values and analyze trends in data.
